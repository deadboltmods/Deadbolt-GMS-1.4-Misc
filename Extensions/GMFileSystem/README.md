## Notes

The file `GMResources.gml` is not needed. It contains GML functions, which are merged into the base game in vanilla. Also, these functions aren't used by the game, so this file is entirely unnecessary.

Also, the file `GMXML.dll` contains XML functions, and none of these are used in the game, despite the presence of `GMXML.dll` in the vanilla game files.
