# Deadbolt-GameMaker-1.4

Public repo for modding [Deadbolt](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394970/DEADBOLT/) in GameMaker 1.4.

**Contains no actual game source code.**

You'll need:

- [UMT](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool): Export and re-import code and sprites. This is the fastest and easiest way to apply small-scale mods.
- [Gamemaker 1.4 Docs](https://docs.yoyogames.com/): Learn GM's bespoke programming language to turn game-changing ideas into playable code. Knowing the basics of programming (e.g., arrays & `for` loops) is enough to get started.

You can also use:

- [Gamemaker Studio 1.4](https://github.com/ithinkandicode/Deadbolt-GameMaker-1.4/issues/11): Apply your mods in the original development environment, and re-compile the game. The is the best approach for huge mods requiring new scripts and refactors, but it's slow to compile and there are many issues to fix. The [issues](https://github.com/ithinkandicode/Deadbolt-GameMaker-1.4/issues) will help you here.
